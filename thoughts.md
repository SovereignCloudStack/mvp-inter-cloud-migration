# Just a bunch of unsorted thoughts

- Velero would be a good candidate when it comes to kubernetes workload migration
- Potential software that already can solve VM migration:
  - <https://github.com/os-migrate/os-migrate>
    - seems we are too new with versions (openstack and openstacksdk)
    - api and variable names changed
    - upstream request was made: <https://github.com/os-migrate/os-migrate/issues/605>
  - <https://github.com/Mirantis/CloudFerry>
    - seems very outdated (Juno latest supported release)
  - <https://github.com/cloudbase/coriolis>
    - looks promising, but needs very deep integration into OpenStack - might not be feasible
